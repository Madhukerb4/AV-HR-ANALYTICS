# AV-HR-ANALYTICS
Analytics Vidya HR Analytics Challenge

1. Under Sampling for Class Imbalance dataset has given better result
2. StratifiedKFold cross validation method is used to identify optimized parameters for models
3. Filter methods and Chi-Square is used for Feature Selection

Models Build : 
1. Logistic Regression
2. XGBoost
3. LightGBM
4. Voting Classification with Logistic Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM

Sections:

1. Explanatory Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection 
4. Models build

Evaluation Metric: F1 Score

Best F1 score for each model:

1. Logistic Regression : 43.3
